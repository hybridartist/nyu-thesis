										<h2>Why</h2>
										<p>A Paradigm Shift in Interactivity</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Regardless of the technologies enabling MR environments, the new range of input modalities creates a paradigm shift from one-to-one interaction between a human and an interface (Greenfield 16). Inputs such as gesture, voice, gaze, and locomotion provide many opportunities for interactions that are more intuitive than a touchscreen or keyboard. However they also provide more room for breakdowns in communication and user error. Sensing raises new questions as to how a user knows if the system has received and understood a request, is executing a task, or how to undo a mistake (Bellotti et al. 415).

										Failures in software projects cost the US economy an estimated $25 to $75 billion annually, and many of the reasons for failure are preventable (Charette 1). UX research conducted up front can help avoid some of these failures such as badly defined system requirements, poor communication among customers, users and developers, and stakeholder politics. Delivery without adequate requirements from customers and users is a problem found in 73% of failed software projects (Cerpa and Verner 133). However the current state of the field prioritizes shipping product over proper UCD process.

										The software industry’s reaction to failed projects has been to abandon traditional plan-based methods in favor of agile software development practices. Agile methods have impacted the way software is developed worldwide even though there is little empirical evidence on their effects (Dybå and Dingsøyr 834). Agile dismisses up-front research and requirements planning in favor of quick delivery because business needs change. However this conflicts with the UCD approach to research and design at the beginning of a project (McInerney and Maurer 19). Table 1 compares UCD and agile methods. An important difference is that UCD begins evaluation early with low-fidelity designs to test with users and iterate on, while agile emphasizes production-ready code to be evaluated at the end of an iteration. UX research is necessary to understand users, whose needs change little over time, while the features and technologies change rapidly (Beyer et al. 55). Lightweight tools for the UCD process, such as scenarios and personas, are effective ways to make it more agile and to communicate a strategic UX vision with team members and stakeholders (Kollmann et al. 15).
