Hi! I’m Shannon Holloway, a lifelong artist and professional problem solver.

As a designer and researcher I'm passionate about human-centered design and improving human-machine interaction for workers performing critical tasks.

I received my BA in the Practice of Art from the University of California at Berkeley and am currently pursuing an MS in Human Factors and Ergonomics from New York University Tandon School of Engineering. I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.hfes.org" target="blank">Human Factors and Ergonomics Society</a> and <a href="http://dfanyu.com/" target="blank">Design for America</a> at NYU.

When I’m not designing I enjoy working on my own artistic and DIY projects, riding my bike or getting lost in a good sci-fi novel.
