<p>After testing out many open-source Jekyll themes the new site is finally here.</p>

<p>I tried over a dozen themes where I encountered an issue in the development process and had to make the choice to scrap it and start over. Cheers to letting go and learning.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://html5up.net/dopetrope" target="blank">DopeTrope</a>
 theme suited most of my needs to start with and I did plenty of customizing from there. <a href="https://html5up.net/" target="blank">HTML5 UP</a> has some other free themes under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/" target="blank">Creative Commons Attribution</a> License.</p>

<p>Hello world!</p>
