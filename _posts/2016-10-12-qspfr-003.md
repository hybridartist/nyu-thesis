				I was stuck trying to think of another simple 2D way to test my idea. I realized I needed to have a better idea of the user journey in order to envision what the experience would be like. I created a storyboard of a visitor arriving at the MAGNET elevator lobby and trying to navigate her way to the main lecture hall, or "red room". From these sketches the user experience and features of the interface begin to take shape.

			<h3>Interactive Prototype<h3>

			<p>
				I created a MAGNET welcome sign with an augmented reality code embedded in it. I posted the sign in the elevator lobby on a wall where room numbers and arrows are painted as part of the existing wayfinding system. A visitor can use their mobile phone to scan the code and see an augmented reality overlay of the floor map and a tip that the lecture hall/"red room" is room 800.
