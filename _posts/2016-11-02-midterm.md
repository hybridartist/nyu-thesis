		<h4>Prototype Journey</h4>

			 A look back at the prototypes I've made thus far.

			 This week I was inspired by elements in nature used by animals and humans in history to navigate. Sea turtles are born on the beach with an innate ability to navigate, using the light from the stars and sun to go to the water and then using magnetic fields to navigate in the ocean.

			 As part of my research this week I played around with Google Tilt Brush to get more familiar with experiencing virtual environments with a HMD. I learned elements close to the eyes hurt after a while, even in the periphery it can get claustrophobic, and since each brush stroke I created was within arms length of me I could only escape using the ‘teleport’ feature and stop painting. Meanwhile the stars in the background attracted my attention without imposing on my vision from a comfortable distance and in cool colors.

			 I created a few different prototypes with various combinations of elements such as landmarks, paths, and edges.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started with a navigational North Star

			Adding a night sky as an edge

			And guiding stars as a path

			I also imagined a turtle navigating to the sun

			With the beach as a path
			<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/005-bird-vision-south.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
			And a shore line for an edge

		</p>
		<p>
			Also I read an article recently that imagined an MR environment would enable you to have a red carpet roll out in front of you wherever you go. I thought this was funny since red carpets in real life function as navigational aids. Creating a digital red carpet experience seems much less satisfying - the color is garish and alarming in a digital context where red usually signifies error or emergency. This version is quite the opposite of my natural prototypes since many animals can see ultraviolet (UV) light and can’t see colors at the upper end of the human visible spectrum such as oranges and reds.

		<h4>Propose a Solution</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			My proposed solution would incorporate elements from nature into a wayfinding system aided by additional symbolic elements as needed.

		<h4>Questions for Discussion</h4>
	</header>
		<p>
			<li>In which environments or contexts would this seem most and least helpful?</li>
			<li>Where does my proposed solution fall in the range of subtle/loud, integrated/imposed?</li>
			<li>Which elements seem most and least effective? (paths, landmarks, edges)</li> 
			<li>What elements are missing? (directional symbols, distance, map, route overview)</li>
			<li>Are there quick ways to build and test working prototypes for HMDs?</li>
