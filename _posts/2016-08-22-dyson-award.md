<p>I'm pleased to announced that I have been selected as one of the 2016-17 James Dyson DFA Design Leaders.</p> 

<p>As a Dyson DFA Leader, I received support to attend the DFA Leadership Studio at Northwestern Univeristy this summer. It was a great opportunity to meet designers from campuses across the US and hone my leadership and human-centered design skills.</p>

<p>I will be conducting a rapid prototyping for social impact workshop and continue to actively participate in the NYU DFA studio. Stay tuned!</p>
