										<p>How might we promote the human-centered design of mixed reality environments?</p>

									<p>
										The line is blurring between our physical and digital worlds. There is a new hybrid existence being created by the proliferation of displays in our real environment and the integration of the real world in virtual environments. Mixed reality is a continuum of environments between completely real environments and virtual ones. Mixed reality poses new challenges for interactions in both our physical and virtual worlds. In mixed reality environments, humans interact with real and virtual objects together in context. However the technologies that enable mixed reality are designed for direct user interaction rather than considering the larger context within which a human interacts with a system. This creates a fragmented user experience and forces users to be split between real and virtual worlds. A design process focused on human needs in context contributes to more positive user experience outcomes and user acceptance of mixed reality technologies. How might we promote the human-centered design of mixed reality environments?
